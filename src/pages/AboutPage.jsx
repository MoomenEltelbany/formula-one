                    Hey there üëã I'm Moomen Eltelbany, a self-taught front-end
                    developer with a love for clean interfaces, logical
                    structures, and everything React.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-300">
                    I started learning web development because I've always
                    enjoyed the mix of creativity and problem-solving ‚Äî it's
                    that sweet spot where design meets logic. What began as
                    curiosity quickly turned into a full passion for building
                    smooth, accessible, and well-structured web apps.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-300">
                    I'm making a career shift into tech, bringing with me a lot
                    of persistence, adaptability, and a genuine drive to keep
                    improving every single day.

                    This project is one I'm really proud of ‚Äî a Formula 1 stats
                    and standings web app built with React, Vite, Tailwind, and
                    React Router v7.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-300">
                    I wanted to go beyond simple ‚Äútutorial apps‚Äù and challenge
                    myself with something complex and data-driven. The app lets
                    users explore teams, drivers, and standings with dynamically
                    fetched data, smooth navigation, and clean UI transitions.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-300">
                    Working on this helped me strengthen my understanding of
                    React Router's loaders, async data fetching, and state
                    management, while also learning how to keep a large file
                    structure organized and scalable. It's been the project
                    where I've grown the most ‚Äî both technically and mentally.
